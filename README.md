# Weather Forecast

Table of Contents

A site where a user can check the weather in any city or town around the world.
The top left part of the site contains the submit form where the user can type the name of the town they wish to check the weather for. Below the searchbar there is a history panel which contains previous searches. The site not only presents the current weather of the area but also gives a five-day forecast on the bottom part of the screen.
